 What ever happened to pure escapism that entertains all comers? Does everything need to have a deeper social/political (and therefore usually left-liberal progressive) message?
Zootopia was "hand holding" social commentary. It's going to get this much attention because it's allegory was so simplified. Inside Out was easily Disney's most important movie. Zootopia is a good movie until it tries to preach.

That's what big blockbuster movies are for. I can see your point and it's valid, but why can't a film be both? Why does it only have to be mindless "hand holding" entertainment?
