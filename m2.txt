Inside this entertaining Disney movie is a real look at what happens when different people and cultures find themselves crammed together in the same space. It’s not always peaceful, nor is it pretty. Bias, and outright prejudice, exist. Some is overt, much is born from fear, and some comes from the most well-meaning of places, from those individuals who simply don’t think through the consequences of their actions. Sometimes it comes from us, even when we don’t mean it to. Stop me if any of this sounds familiar, in a ripped-from-the-headlines kind of way. But Zootopia doesn’t push, and it doesn’t preach. There’s an important lesson to be learned here, and as it is wrapped in a Disney animated feature, it has the potential to reach places where it might not otherwise be heard.
