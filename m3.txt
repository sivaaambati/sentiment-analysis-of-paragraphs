One of the reasons Frozen has become as popular as it has is because of the way Disney put a twist on the romantic tropes that Disney itself helped to create. Zootopia doesn’t shy away from self-examination, either. Here, there is a focus on the importance of taking action in order to realize your dreams. It’s a (polite) shot at the idea that your dreams will come true “when you wish upon a star.” In Zootopia, wishing won’t make it so. If you want something, you have to work to make it happen. It’s made all the more clear that Disney is willing to take an honest look at itself when it actually uses Frozen as the focus for its criticism, because as much as that movie did some things differently, it still did quite a bit by the numbers.

From a technical standpoint, Zootopia is top-notch. The animation is spectacular. All the animals look amazing. In close-up, each creature looks truly alive. Each animal hair looks as though it were individually animated to react to its environment. Action sequences are tight, exciting, and a joy to watch. You’ll find yourself scanning every frame in the city looking for each available detail (and joke), and you won’t be disappointed. The voice cast is perfect. In addition to Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, we get the talents of J.K. Simmons, Idris Elba and Shakira, among others [including Alan Tudyk, who is well on his way to becoming Disney's good luck charm]. Every actor and character is perfectly matched.

If all you’re looking for is a fun matinee the family will enjoy, Zootopia will provide everything that you need. But for the “older kids” in the room, Zootopia provides a parable with a lesson for anybody old enough to understand it. Finally, it will leave you with a pop song from Shakira that’s going to burrow into your brain and leave you humming it for days.
